                    <p>Hello! Wow, somehow, you've landed here to learn more about me. I'm thrilled! For starters, I'm gearing up to make a career change. 
                        I'm currently in a successful sales career, but looking for something more hands on.
                        What I enjoy most about my current career is the challange, working with a team and solving problems.
                        I'm hoping to continue this in a career with software development.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Naturally, I've always been the kind of person who likes to work on a project (or skill) and see the outcome.
                        My most recent project is converting a 1992 Ford Mustang with a 4cyl motor into a 5.0 Mustang.
                        I could have bought one, but I wouldn't have learned how to:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove and replace a motor, transmission and exhaust.</li>
                            <li>Replace clutch and brake cable.</li>
                            <li>Upgrade the front and rear brakes (calipers, pads, rotors, spindles and all).</li>
                            <li>Replace front and rear suspension parts with:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Lowering springs.</li>
                                    <li>New struts and bushings.</li>
                                    <li>Heavier duty rear control arms.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Replace the fuel lines and brake lines.</li>
                            <li>Replace the rear axel, suspension and struts.</li>
                            <li>Replace engine wiring harness, transmition harness and computer module.</li>
                            <li>Replace gauge cluster.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>The subject here doesn't directly correlate with computer programming, but the idea of this does. I did this all by reading forum
                        after forum after forum and teaching myself how to do everything. It's a great feeling of accomplishment
                        and confidence to know I can learn and teach myself with hard work and dedication.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Aside from this, my wife and I are expecting a baby girl very soon and live with our 2 Boxers - all of which
                        I couldn't be any happier with. I also enjoy cooking, craft beer, music and exercise. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Please take a look around! Feel free to send me a quick note in the contact section! Thank you.
